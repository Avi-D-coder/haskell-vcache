-- VCache uses LMDB with the MDB_NOLOCK option, mostly because I don't
-- want to deal with the whole issue of OS bound threads or a limit on
-- number of concurrent readers. Without locks, we essentially have 
-- frame buffer concurrency with three frames. LMDB directly preserves
-- the most recent two frames.
--
-- RWLock essentially enforces this sort of frame-buffer concurrency.
-- A writer will wait for older readers, but not for readers of the 
-- most recent frame. Assuming short-lived readers, this should exhibit
-- a suitably high degree of parallelism.

-- and the previous one, and f2 has readers for a previous safe frame 
-- and what will become an unsafe frame after the writer reuses some
-- 'free' pages.
